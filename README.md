Developed an Electronic Voting machine provided with switches belonging to different parties. With this device, voters will be allowed to choose their preferred candidate from the panel of buttons. The final vote is then displayed onto an LCD for the satisfaction of voters. In the end, the result is automatically calculated by pressing the result button. We have used Arduino UNO to perform all the tasks.
